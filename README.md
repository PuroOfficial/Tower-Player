Higher Performance | No Multi-touch (unless have a touchscreen)

## Compiling

If you want to compile your project with your changes, Please note that it runs better with Visual Studio 2019.

If you made modifications to your local repository, You can use this information to Build it for Windows as well.


I think you can figure the rest of the compilation yourself If you use Visual Studio everyday.

**If not:**

Open Project or Solution on the Main Page.

Press Play when you are ready to make changes and compile Tower Player.

**Requirements: .NET Framework 4.8 and Visual Studio 2019**

## Troubleshooting


# Launching Problems
If you can't launch the application because it returns an missing .NET Framework, Install the .NET Framework 4.8

**Still haven't trouble?**

If you can't launch the application because of a missing DLL, Your WebView DLL doesn't support your windows or you accidently deleted the Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.dll (lol how???)


# Deck Loading Problems
If your deck takes more then 2 minutes.
Your DPI is trying to access something else. (most likely affected people in: Russia)
