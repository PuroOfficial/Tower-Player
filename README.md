Higher Performance | No Multi-touch (unless have a touchscreen)

## Troubleshooting


# Launching Problems
If you can't launch the application because it returns an missing .NET Framework, Install the .NET Framework 4.8

**Still haven't trouble?**

If you can't launch the application because of a missing DLL, Your WebView DLL doesn't support your windows or you accidently deleted the Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.dll (lol how???)


# Deck Loading Problems
If your deck takes more then 2 minutes.
Your DPI is trying to access something else. (most likely affected people in: Russia)
